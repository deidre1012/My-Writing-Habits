# My-Writing-Habits

Typically when I am in the process of writing an assignment, document, or essay, I will begin by brainstorming about what idea I want to discuss (if I am able to choose the topic).  Following my decision on the topic I will gradually do research with small amounts of time that I have between classes, work, or other homework.  From there I will sit down (normally on a weekend) with no one else around to focus on the writing.  I tend to like writing in large portions because I do not stay focused very well when I have to write a long essay.  So taking several hours at a time with no one else around I am better able to allow myself time to process my thoughts.  Then after the weekend I will take sorter amounts of time to go back through the writing to edit.  

Improvements that are avaible for my writing habits is to jot down ideas and notes before writing so much at once.  This would allow my writing to have ideas prior to writing instead of sitting an thinking about ideas. 

The strength of my habit is to be able to get most of the writing done at once with minimal distractions, and so I can explain my thoughts as clear and concise as possible.
